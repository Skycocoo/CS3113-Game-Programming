# Racing - a platformer final project for CS3113

# Dependencies

Please make sure you have these libraries installed before using [cmake](https://cmake.org/) to build

```
- OpenGL (find packages with cmake)
- GLEW (find packages with cmake)
- glm (included in the folder)

- SDL_mixer (find packages with cmake modules)
- SDL2 (find packages with cmake modules)
- SDL2_Image (find packages with cmake modules)
```

If those packages cannot be found by cmake modules, then their paths might need to be manually changed in  CMakeCache.txt


# Installation with cmake

Clone this project: (Note that I use .gitmodules to include glm, the clone should be in recursive mode)

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:Skycocoo/CS3113-Game-Programming.git --recursive
$ cd ./final\ project
```

If forgot to add ```--recursive``` flag:

```bash
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Make build directory for cmake:
```bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd ./build/
```

Run cmake & build executable for this project:

```bash
$ cmake ..
$ make
```
Run the executable of this project:

```bash
$ ./main
```


## Requirement

- [x] title screen and proper mode for game over

- [x] music and sound effects

- [x] at least 3 different levels

- [x] multiplayer

- [x] some animation

- [x] shader effects


## Todo

1. Enemy AI (IDLE: wandering around the base point; CHASING: *path finding* to the player & shoot bullets); if destroyed by player: generated by certain time-steps?

2. When player die: destroy the trap & create a box to help the player to go further

3. Animate the menu levels (fading in & out; natural movement of title with perlin noise); [text rendering](https://learnopengl.com/In-Practice/Text-Rendering)

4. Animate jumping with small particle effects
