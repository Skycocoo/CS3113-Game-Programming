# Racing - final project for CS3113

## Comments

Some other games made for CS3113 Game Programming are stored in branch ```archive```


# Final Project Description

# Dependencies

Please make sure you have these libraries installed before cmake

```
- OpenGL (find packages with cmake)
- GLEW (find packages with cmake)
- glm (included in the folder)

- SDL_mixer (find packages with cmake modules)
- SDL2 (find packages with cmake modules)
- SDL2_Image (find packages with cmake modules)
```


# Installation with cmake

Clone this project: (Note that I use .gitmodules to include glm, the clone should be in recursive mode)

```bash
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/Skycocoo/Racing-Game.git
$ cd ./Racing-Game
```

Make build directory for cmake:
```bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd ./build/
```

Run cmake & build executable for this project:

```bash
$ cmake ..
$ make
```
Run the executable of this project:

```bash
$ ./main
```


## Requirement

- [x] title screen and proper mode for game over

- [x] music and sound effects

- [x] at least 3 different levels

- [x] multiplayer

- [x] some animation

## Option

- [ ] procedurally generated levels

- [ ] AI

- [ ] particle effects

## Extra Credits

- [ ] running on phone

- [ ] 3D elements

- [x] shader effects


## Todo

1. Animate the player & enemy (by the sprite sheet; if its moving / jumping / ...)

2. Animate the menu levels (fading in & out; natural movement of title with perlin noise); [text rendering](https://learnopengl.com/In-Practice/Text-Rendering)

3. Animate jumping with small particle effects

4. Implement enemy's AI (IDLE: wandering around the base point; CHASING: *path finding* to the player & shoot bullets); if destroyed by player: generated by certain time-steps?

5. 3D elements for transitioning different levels?

6. Add 3 different levels / random (procedurally) generated levels
